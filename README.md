# WELCOME TO THE SUPPORT APP PROJECT

At the request of my client, I have developed an application so that the company's employees can create requests (from their respective profile) for technical problems, as well as edit these requests and delete them if necessary. 

The employees will only be able to access this application once the company provides them with their respective users and passwords (which will be stored in the H2 database) and from their profile they will be able to store the necessary tickets.

This project has been done individually with the intention of practicing and getting started in the backend.
